Assumptions
-----------

* The program only supports default log format, not custom.
* The program only supports version 2 of the flow log format.

Instructions
------------

1. Save the flow log data in a file named `flow_log.txt`.
2. Save the lookup table in a file named `lookup_table.csv`.
3. Run the program using `python program.py`.
4. The output will be generated in a file named `output.txt`.

Tests
-----
